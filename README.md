### Description

Quantum superposition is a physics concept that light and matter can be both particle and wave at the same time. This amazing phenomenon can be demonstrated at home when you try to plug in a USB Type A cable in, it's both right-side-up and upside-down at the same time! That's why you have to try at least 3 times to plug it in.

The Adafruit Reversible USB Type A Plug Connector Breakout solves this issue by having a thin contact piece in the middle, so you can plug it either way and it always has the same pin-out. Great for boards with indicator LEDs or displays that need to be facing 'up' or 'out' no matter which way the port is setup.

The connector we use is half through-hole and half-SMT, so there's a good mechanical connection to the PCB via mounting tabs. You get all four classic USB connectors (5V, ground, D+ and D-) plus a 'shield' contact for the metal body. We also toss in a small bit of header in case you want to use this in a perf or bread board.
